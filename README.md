## About

Bash library for writing shell applications.

Does **not** work with bash in POSIX mode due to the way the "namespacing" is defined for its modules.

## Project goals

 * modular design
 * proper documentation (none at the moment, the code is my docs)
 * tested code (with [shunit2](https://code.google.com/p/shunit2/))

**Warning:** development version. Things will break, function names and arguments will change.
